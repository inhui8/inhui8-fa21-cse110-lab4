1. print the value 3, because since the price has 100, 200, 300, so the prices.length will be 3
and the for loop will run 3 times and i will be 3 at the end of the loop, since var defined can use out of 
the for loop, thus it will print 3.
2. it will print 150, since for loop will run 3 times base on the prices.length, and the discountedPrice will be upgrade three times and last time the value will be maintain which is 300 * 0.5 = 150, since the var declare, so in line 13 it will print the value of discountedPrice which is 150
3. The line 14 will print the finalPrice value, so it will print 150 since the finalPrice will be 150 after the for loop.
4. it will return an array and its length which is the three prices of the finalPrice, so it is (3) [50, 100, 150]
5. error, because i is declare in for loop by let, so it is means we can not use i outside of the for loop
6. error, because discountedPrice is declare in for loop by let, so it is means we can not use discountedPrice outside of the for loop
7. 150, since the finalPrice is declare in the same function by let, and we can still use it, so the line 14 will print 150 after the for loop end.
8. it will return the array length and  array [50, 100, 150], since the discounted is declare in the same function by let, so it will not have error.
9. error, because i is declare by let and inside the for loop, so it  can not be used for outside for loop, so the i outside for loop did not declare.
10. it will print 3 because the prices.length is 3 and length use const assigned value 3, and it can not be change
11. it will return the array length 3 and the array [50, 100, 150]
12. A.student.name;
    B.student['Grad Year'];
    C.student.greeting();
    D.student['Favorite Teacher'].name;
    E.student.courseLoad[0]
13. A.output: '32' is a string because any operands is a string then the other one will convert to a string in + .
    B.output: 1 is a number because in -, '3' will be number
    C.output: 3 is a number because null can be 0
    D.output: '3null' is a string becasue '3' is string and in + the other one will become string
    E.output: 4 is number because true can become 1
    F.output: 3 is number because false can become 0
    G.output: '3undefined' is a string because '3' is string and in + the other one will become string
    H.output: NaN is number type but since it is - undefined, so it becomes NaN
14. A.output: true because the string '2' becomes a number 2
    B.output: false because 
    C.output: true
    D.output: false because the type is different
    E.output: false becuase true ==1, so true <2
    F.output: true
15. == use to compare two variables, and it will not compare the datatype of varibles, but === both compare the variables and their types.
16.
